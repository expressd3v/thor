# Thor 

## Description

Thor is a simple and efficient tool for building self-documenting command line utilities.  It removes the pain of parsing command line options, writing "USAGE:" banners, and can also be used as an alternative to the [Rake](http://github.com/jimweirich/rake) build tool.  The syntax is Rake-like, so it should be familiar to most Rake users. 

## Installation

$ gem install thor

or

$ gem install wycats-thor -s http://gems.github.com

## Usage and documentation

Please see [the wiki](https://github.com/wycats/thor/wiki) for basic usage and other documentation on using Thor.
